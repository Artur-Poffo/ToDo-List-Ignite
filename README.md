To deepen my knowledge I'm taking the Rocketseat Ignite course, I started recently.

This is the first challenge on the updated React.js trail.

I'm actually really enjoying this course, mainly because of the organization of the platform and the challenges, so if you're thinking of signing up, I recommend it.
